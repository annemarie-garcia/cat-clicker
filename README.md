# cat-clicker

This is an excercise (not a formally submitted project) that I did as part of my Udacity Nano Degree.

It is an example of some functionality that seperates concerns in JavaScript. The main focus of the project was to seperate the JavaScript into three sections - the model, octopus(controller) and the view. Within the view, there were three sections created - one that dealt with the catMenu (left hand side), one that dealt with the Admin, and one that dealt with the rest of the View.
